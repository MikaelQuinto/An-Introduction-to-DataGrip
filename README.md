# DataGrip Custom üé® (OPTIONAL)
### Description
This is a small optional section of the guide that you can skip. It focuses on customization to make your experience with DataGrip more pleasant and user-friendly.

## Customize
- Theme: If you're like me and find bright screens a bit overwhelming, you can switch to Dark Mode, which is especially helpful for reducing eye strain at night.
- IDE Font: If you need larger text for better visibility when working with data or writing code, you can adjust the font size here.
- Region: You can set the region to Americas in the Region option, though this isn‚Äôt crucial. Keep in mind that changing this setting requires a restart.

## Plugins
To search for plugins, go to the search bar and type the names of the plugins you want to find.

- A must-have plugin is Atom Material Icons, which replaces file icons with their relevant logos, making navigation more intuitive.
- If you want more theme options, I highly recommend Material Theme UI, which offers a variety of stylish and customizable themes.
