- Next, the file will start downloading. Once it's finished, open it. Note: Registration on EDB is not required.

## ⚙️STEP 2 - Installation 🛠️ 
- Now, a setup window will appear. Click "Next." This setup process is a bit more complex than the previous one, so pay close attention.
- In the Installation Directory screen, simply click "Next."

- In the Data Directory screen, click "Next."
- Now, in the Password section—this part is **very important**. Enter a password that **you will remember**, as we will need it frequently to access the database. If you're unsure, **write it down somewhere safe** or use another method to store it securely.
- In the Port section, leave it as 5432 and click "Next" to proceed.
- In the Advanced Options section, leave everything as it is and click "Next," just like in the Pre-Installation Summary screen.
- Once the installation is complete, click "Finish," and that's it! 😊

# DataGrip Custom 🎨 (OPTIONAL)
### Description
This is a small optional section of the guide that you can skip. It focuses on customization to make your experience with DataGrip more pleasant and user-friendly.

## Customize
- Theme: If you're like me and find bright screens a bit overwhelming, you can switch to Dark Mode, which is especially helpful for reducing eye strain at night.
- IDE Font: If you need larger text for better visibility when working with data or writing code, you can adjust the font size here.
- Region: You can set the region to Americas in the Region option, though this isn’t crucial. Keep in mind that changing this setting requires a restart.

## Plugins
To search for plugins, go to the search bar and type the names of the plugins you want to find.

- A must-have plugin is Atom Material Icons, which replaces file icons with their relevant logos, making navigation more intuitive.
- If you want more theme options, I highly recommend Material Theme UI, which offers a variety of stylish and customizable themes.
